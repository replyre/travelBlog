hello coders !!
This was one of my first sites I built while learning React.
This is the Source file (Src), as I used a single app to create many sites to save space.

You need to create your react app through cmd
using: npm create-react-app travelBlog (windows)
or   : yarn add  create-react-app  travelBlog (MacOS)

Then delete everything in the Src folder (nothing else) and copy the files here to that folder.

To render images, copy the images folder(not cut, as 2 images are used from src) and paste it in the public folder.

Come back to Cmd and type : npm start 

and there you go.
